Jigsaw Comment Classification Challenge Dataset

The Jigsaw dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for toxicity detection. It contains user-generated comments from Wikipedia, labeled with different types of toxicity. The dataset is publicly available and has been used for various NLP classification tasks.

Dataset Details

The dataset consists of the following files:

train.csv: Contains the training data with labeled comments.

test.csv: Contains the test data without labels.

test_labels.csv: Provides the actual labels for the test dataset but is released separately to avoid overfitting.

Each file contains user comments along with metadata and toxicity classification labels. The labels indicate whether a comment falls into categories such as toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, or identity hate.
