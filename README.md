Overview-

GenAI Toxic Shield is an AI-powered system designed to detect and moderate toxic comments using generative AI models. The project focuses on analyzing text from online platforms, identifying harmful content, and providing moderation recommendations.

SOLUTION-

Our solution involves a Generative AI-based model that identifies toxic comments and classifies them using transformer-based architecture (GPT). We fine-tune the model using the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification dataset to recognize multiple categories of toxicity, such as threats, insults, and hate speech. The model preprocesses input text before tokenization, then generates embeddings for accurate classification.

HOW IT HELPS TO SOLVE TH EPROBEM- 

Our AI solution provides automated, real-time detection and moderation of toxic comments, reducing the spread of misinformation and harmful speech online. The generative AI component ensures that flagged content is reworded in a non-toxic manner, encouraging positive communication.

DATASET- 
Jigsaw Comment Classification Challenge Dataset(https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)

The Jigsaw dataset is a widely used benchmark dataset for toxicity detection. It contains user-generated comments from Wikipedia, labeled with different types of toxicity. The dataset is publicly available and has been used for various NLP classification tasks.

Dataset Details

The dataset consists of the following files:

train.csv: Contains the training data with labeled comments.

test.csv: Contains the test data without labels.

test_labels.csv: Provides the actual labels for the test dataset but is released separately to avoid overfitting.

Each file contains user comments along with metadata and toxicity classification labels. The labels indicate whether a comment falls into categories such as toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, or identity hate.

Source: Wikipedia discussion pages

Size: 223,000+ comments

INPUT METRICS-

Reduction in flagged toxic comments.

Increased user trust in moderated content.

Improvement in engagement and platform safety scores.

Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the classification model.

FEATURES-

Toxic comment detection using NLP models

Sentiment analysis for content evaluation

Real-time moderation and filtering

Generative AI-based rewording for flagged comments
