Overview-

GenAI Toxic Shield is an AI-powered system designed to detect and moderate toxic comments using generative AI models. The project focuses on analyzing text from online platforms, identifying harmful content, and providing moderation recommendations.

SOLUTION-

Our solution involves a Generative AI-based model that identifies toxic comments and classifies them using transformer-based architecture (GPT). We fine-tune the model using the Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification dataset to recognize multiple categories of toxicity, such as threats, insults, and hate speech. The model preprocesses input text before tokenization, then generates embeddings for accurate classification.

HOW IT HELPS TO SOLVE TH EPROBEM- 

Our AI solution provides automated, real-time detection and moderation of toxic comments, reducing the spread of misinformation and harmful speech online. The generative AI component ensures that flagged content is reworded in a non-toxic manner, encouraging positive communication.

INPUT METRICS-

Reduction in flagged toxic comments.

Increased user trust in moderated content.

Improvement in engagement and platform safety scores.

Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score of the classification model.

FEATURES-

Toxic comment detection using NLP models

Sentiment analysis for content evaluation

Real-time moderation and filtering

Generative AI-based rewording for flagged comments

API integration for seamless deployment

INSTALLATION-

PREREQUISITES-

Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.8+

Jupyter Notebook

Required Python libraries (listed in requirements.txt)

USAGE-

Input text comments for analysis.

The model processes the text and detects toxicity levels.

AI evaluates the sentiment and flags inappropriate content.

If toxicity is detected, the AI suggests rewording.

The results are displayed with necessary recommendations.

MODEL AND APPROACH-

Uses NLP-based techniques to detect toxic language.

Implements sentiment analysis and content moderation.

Fine-tuned generative AI models for accurate classification.
